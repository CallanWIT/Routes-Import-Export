Routes Import/Export

It's a small extension for Routes addon adding and simple and needed import/export functionality.

To share a route with your friends / viewers open Routes window (console command: /routes) select that route. At the end of the Information tab there is a new Export text box populated with text. Copy it (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) and send / post that text anywhere you like.

To import a route, copy shared text, open Routes window (console command /routes), select Routes section. You can see a new Import text box. Paste route data to import (Ctrl+V) and click the Accept button. A new route should be added to the tree.

Routes can be renamed through Name field on the Information tab (added in v1.0.3).
